# Mapping the Montreal Musicscape, An Interactive AudioCast APP

By: Alana DeVito

Mapping the Montreal MusicScape is an Interactive AudioCast that leads users to different locations around Montreal to uncover, listen to and collect different 'Audio Gems' that represent that unqiue neighbourhood in Montreal. The soundscape, playlist, interview, story or some other type of audio piece created and submitted by an audioCast user can be found by users when their geolocation tracked by the app enters specific lat and long points in that neighbourhood. While the user can only access these 'audio Gems' when they enter that specific location, they can collect those pieces and listen or re-listen later when they are no longer in that location.

This is a mockup app that only retrieves, displays saves and stores data that would then be used to direct the user to the appropriate audio pieces (or 'gems') 'hidden' around the city.
There are currently no audio files active in this mock-up.
The design is only a rough sketch of the actual mobile app graphic design and user interface. All graphics, font and colours should be considered temporary.

Interaction and User Direction:
-Upon opening up the app or going to the website on your mobile phone (can be accessed on desktops/laptops as well, but it is not size responsive to a larger screen)- the user is prompted to enter in a User Name and Password if they have not logged on before. If they have, and get their name or password incorrect, they will be asked to create a new user name and password.

- NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, TO BE ADDED: Next prompt will ask the user is they would like to listen to CJLO live online or listen to a generative ambient soundscape during their audio hunt (this will stop once they find the 'audioGems').

- The user name will be displayed on the app under name (in the blue box).
- NEXT: The user chooses the neighbourhood that they would like to start their audioCast hunt in (choose the neighbourhood that best describes where they are) with the drop down menu that says 'Choose where you would like to hunt.' below 'Hunt Neighbourhood'.

- NEXT: The user chooses how they would like to hunt for the audio under 'How would you like to hunt?'' in the dropbox underneath that says 'Choose the method or randomize.'

  - the Hunt methods are :
    - Mystery walk (Abstract audio direction only. A audio signal will get louder or quieter as they get closer or further away from an item they are searching.)
    - Direct me with words.
    - Map only. ( Pressing the 'See MMMap' Button in the upper right corner will always show the map, but this method will not provide other assistance. (the 'See MMMAP' button is not active in this mock-up.)
    - Random will choose one of the above methods.

- NEXT: The user chooses the type of audio gem that they would like to seek out under 'What kind of audio gem are you hunting?' in the dropdown menu that says 'Choose the type or randomize.'
  - the Audio Gem types are:
    - Soundscape
    - Interview
    - Story
    - Playlist
    - User Created - Users can create their own audio Gems and submit to be included in their chosen neighbourhood (preferably something that represents the neighbourhood to them).
    - Random will choose one of the above methods.
- NEXT: At the bottom of the app, the user's choices will be displayed - 'how they are searching' TO 'what type of audio gem' IN 'neighbourhood' - this section is in pink under 'My Current Hunt'.

  - Also, the title of what they will be searching for is in the yellow box at the very bottom under 'Currently Hunting'.

- NEXT (NOT ACTIVE) : The user will listen to an ambient soundscape or CJLO live radio while they hunt for the audio gems in their neighbourhood.
- As the user collects 'Audio Gems' they can see the amount they've collected in a pink box titled 'Audio Gems Collected'.

- Each time a user opens their app their last search will be active until they change the parameters, ending with the audio gem type.

Next steps will be integrating geolocation into this app.
